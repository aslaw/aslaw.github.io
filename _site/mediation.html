			<h2>Mediation</h2>			

<p>	Mediation has increasingly become the preferred choice as people realize that their disputes do not have to land in court.  Rather, mediation is an alternative which has a track record of over 90% success in resolving not only simple but also complex multi-million dollar multi-party disputes.  Resolving disputes in front of a judge of OR jury costs everyone much more time and money than resolving them disputes using mediation.  Mediation is a process which embodies the concepts of efficiency, empowerment and conservation of everyone's time and energy.</p>

<p>Mediation is voluntary.  Parties negotiate their own agreement in a safe setting with the assistance of a trained mediator. Parties choose whether or not to enter into mediation, as well as how long they continue to try to reach a resolution in mediation.  The earlier mediation occurs in the litigation process, the more control parties will have over the resolution of their matter. </p>

<p>Parties carry on settlement discussions with confidentiality agreements so that the parties can feel free to discuss facts that are not later admissible in legal proceedings.</p>

<p>The mediator is trained to assist the parties in resolving their dispute with or without their attorneys.  The mediator She is a neutral facilitator, is not a judge of the issues, and has no authority to decide the outcome of the case.- (I moved this here instead of the next paragraph) Once the parties reach an agreement, the mediator assists them in deciding how to enforce their agreement.</p>

<p>Historically, agreements resulting from the mediation process hold over time since the parties themselves craft the terms of the settlement which includes provisions for enforcement of the agreement.  . - what does it mean that the agreements hold over time?  Are you saying they hold over time since they are not a court decision and therefore are not legally binding so it is up to the parties to uphold them?</p>

<p>The following are some other reasons why many choose mediation over litigation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Mediation is economical and maximizes the use of financial resources.  Litigation is generally much more expensive and can result in an outcome that doesn't meet the objectives of either Party.</li> 
	<li>In mediation, the parties involved control the decision making process, whereas in litigation a judge or jury comes up with a ruling that may not satisfy either party.</li>
	<li>Litigation may be a lengthy process; mediation provides parties the opportunity to "move on" rapidly with their lives and businesses.</li>
	<li>Agreements in mediation can be designed using creative solutions and are therefore free from the outcome-oriented judicial procedures of the courtroom or arbitration.</li>
	<li>Agreements can include terms for guarantees of confidentiality when circumstances make confidentiality more comfortable and legally important.</li>
